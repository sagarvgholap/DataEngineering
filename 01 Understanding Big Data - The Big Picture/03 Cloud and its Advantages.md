# Cloud and its Advantages

## On-Permise vs Cloud
- On-Permise
    - 50 node Hadoop cluster
    - you buy 50 nodes
    - you procure a space to keep those nodes
    - cooling equipment

- Cloud
    - taking infrastructure on rent
    - Advantages:
        - Scalable
        - Capex(Capital Expenditure) vs Opex(Operational Expenditure)
        - Agility (on the click of button you can have 10 node cluster with software installed)
        - Geo Distribution
        - Disaster recovery
        - Cost effective

    - 3 types of Clouds
        - Public : Amazon AWS / Microsoft Azure / Google GCP
        - Private : 
            - On Premise vs Private cloud
                -  Private cloud : you will have the UI to get your cluster ready on some clicks and only your people will have the access
        - Hybrid : Public + Private (big companies will have this kind of structure )

- better to learn
    - Microsoft Azure
    - Amazon AWS
